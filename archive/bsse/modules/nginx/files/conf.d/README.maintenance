Block selected hosts for maintenance

The following configuration was used to allow hosts in the ETHZ only, and deny the rest.
The ETHZ IP list can be found from the ETHZ-Intern group in the firewall configs.
You should also add the RFC 1918 addresses as these can only come from within the ETH anyway.
           allow 10.0.0.0/8;
           allow 172.16.0.0/12;
           allow 192.168.0.0/16;

The 3 lines starting with 'error_page' serve a custom 403.html error page /usr/share/nginx/html/403.html,
that can be customized with any message you want. It's just normal HTML and is not puppetized
